## Title: Tutorial/Review on the 'NumPy' package in Python

The aim of this project is to give an overview of the well-known Python package, 'NumPy'. I created a jupyter notebook to clearly explain the function and meaning of the NumPy package as per the objectives of the assignment below. 
The objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Getting Started

1.  If not already installed, download and install Python 3.
2.  Recommend downloading python via Anaconda to get useful additional software including JUpyter and Ipython. BY downloading Anacoda you will also get the 'NumPy' package already built into Python.
3.  Download and install a command prompt - recommend Cmder (Windows) or Terminal (Mac).
4. To run the jupyter notebook on your computer you will need to download the .pynb to your desktop using the clone tab on my Github repository.
5. Once download to your desktop, open your command line
6. Using the 'cd' command on your command line, go to the folder you saved the .pynb file to.
7. Type 'jupyter notebook' or 'jupyter lab' to open up jupyter and click on the .pynb file to view the jupyter notebook.
8. You can also view the jupyter notebook directly on Github by clicking on the link to my repository https://github.com/kevindooley/programming_DA_project_2019
9. Sometimes, the jupyter notebook does not always load on Githib, you can also view on nbviewer using the link https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kevindooley/programming_DA_project_2019/tree/master/
